  To start, let me know which system you use:

instructions:
  first: First you need to download and install the app.
  then: |
    Once everything is installed and you've created a Saent account, you can
    connect your Saent button.

      - |
        Make sure your device is fully charged (plug it in via USB, the light halo will turn yellow while charging; the halo will fill in as the device charges and fully light when the button is completely charged).
      - |
        Download, install, launch the Saent software.
      - |
        Go through the onboarding process and set up a Saent account.
      - |
        Unplug from USB and turn on the device by clicking and holding the top cover for about one second.
      - |
        Click on the Saent taskbar icon.
      - |
        Go to “Saent devices >”. Wait a few seconds until you see your device appear on the list as a string of numbers and select it. (If you are setting up multiple Saent devices in close proximity, it is best to do them one at a time so you can determine which device you are connecting to. Once you have connected the first time, the device name will change to your Saent username in the device list.)
      - |
        The left bottom part of the LED halo should briefly flash a few times in quick succession, indicating it has connected over Bluetooth.
      - |
        If you have not yet gotten a notification update with a new software update, go to the Saent menu in the left top and select “Check for Updates…” to make sure you’re running the latest version. (At present, the firmware can only be updated over Bluetooth.)
      - |
        If a new update is available, follow the instructions on screen. You might get a notification that a firmware upgrade is available. Install it by following the instructions. This can take several minutes, during which the device might seem powered off.
      - |
        Wait until you get a notification that the firmware upgrade has been installed.
      - |
        You are now ready to use the device.

        <em>Note: you do not need to use the included USB Bluetooth dongle, this is only required for Windows users.</em>

        You can navigate through the app by tapping on the left, right, bottom, and top edges of the button.
      - |
        When the Saent app is open, press the button to quickly launch a session (at your default session length).
      - |
        When the Saent app is closed, press the button to launch Saent and immediately jump into a session.
      - |
        When the Saent app is closed, tap the button to open Saent.
      - |
        When the Saent device is not connected to your computer by Bluetooth, you can still use it to time activities away from your computer by pressing the button to start an offline session. For now, this will always be based on your default session length (which you can change under Preferences). The data will be synced (and soon included in your Insights) the next time you connect the device to your computer.

        Make sure Bluetooth on your computer is turned on.
      - |
        Make sure the device is turned on (if you don’t see any light in the LED, it’s turned off or the battery is dead; see battery and charging section).
      - |
        If your device does not connect, start by going to the taskbar icon dropdown menu.
      - |
        Go to “Saent Devices >” and see if your device is listed there. If the device name listed is the same as your username and shows a checkmark next to it, that means it is connected. If it shows another number or code, try reconnecting the device again by turning it off and on again (hold the button two times for 1.5 seconds); this may take a few seconds. Also make sure that you’re logged in to your Saent account.
      - |
        If your username is listed in the device overview, try clicking your name manually and see if the left corner of the LED halo now flashes several times. If so, you should now be connected.
      - |
        If it doesn’t, connect your device through USB. When connecting via USB, plug in your device using the USB cable supplied and wait until you see your device appear in the 'Saent devices' list inside the drop down menu. This may take a minute to connect the first time so please be patient. Then see if it allows you to control the app while connected through USB.
      - |
        Once you’ve done this, please email <a href="mailto:support@saent.com">support@saent.com</a> and let us know whether or not your device communicated with the app while connected through USB. This way we’ll know whether there’s a problem with your Bluetooth connection, or if the entire device is suffering from another problem.

        When the battery starts running out, the left bottom of the arc will begin flashing red.
      - |
        You can charge the device simply by plugging in the USB cable at the top of the button.
      - |
        Once the cable has been plugged in, the LED of the halo should turn yellow.
      - |
        If nothing happens when you plug in the USB cable, please get in touch with our support.
      -
        You can check your battery’s charge by looking at the halo during charging (it will be fully lit when 100% charged) or looking the device drop down menu in the taskbar. (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/x8jyKAE.jpg" target="_blank">Screenshot</a>)
