      <em>Note: you do not need to use the included USB Bluetooth dongle, this is only required for Windows users.</em>


  using:
    - |
      You can navigate through the app by tapping on the left, right, bottom, and top edges of the button.
    - |
      When the Saent app is open, press the button to quickly launch a session (at your default session length).
    - |
      When the Saent app is closed, press the button to launch Saent and immediately jump into a session.
    - |
      When the Saent app is closed, tap the button to open Saent.
    - |
      When the Saent device is not connected to your computer by Bluetooth, you can still use it to time activities away from your computer by pressing the button to start an offline session. For now, this will always be based on your default session length (which you can change under Preferences). The data will be synced (and soon included in your Insights) the next time you connect the device to your computer.

  connectivity:
    - |
      Make sure Bluetooth on your computer is turned on.

    - |
      Make sure the device is turned on (if you don’t see any light in the LED, it’s turned off or the battery is dead; see battery and charging section).
    - |
      If your device does not connect, start by going to the taskbar icon dropdown menu.
    - |
      Go to “Saent Devices >” and see if your device is listed there. If the device name listed is the same as your username with a checkmark next to it, that means it is connected. If it shows another number or code, try reconnecting the device again by turning it off and on again (hold the button two times for 1.5 seconds); this may take a few seconds. Also make sure that you’re logged in to your Saent account.
    - |
      If your username is listed in the device overview, try clicking your name manually and see if the left corner of the LED arc now flashes several times. If so, you should now be connected.
    - |
      If it doesn’t, connect your device through USB. When connecting via USB, plug in your device using the USB cable supplied and wait until you see your device appear in the 'Saent devices' list inside the drop down menu. This may take a minute to connect the first time so please be patient. Then see if it allows you to control the app while connected through USB.
    - |
      Once you’ve done this, please get in touch with our support and let us know whether or not your device communicated with the app while connected through USB. This way we’ll know whether there’s a problem with your Bluetooth connection, or if the entire device is suffering from another problem.

    - |
      When the battery starts running out, the left bottom of the arc will begin flashing red.
    - |
      You can charge the device simply by plugging in the USB cable at the top of the button.
    - |
      Once the cable has been plugged in, the LED of the arc should turn yellow.

      If nothing happens when you plug in the USB cable, please get in touch with our support.
